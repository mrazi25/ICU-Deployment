# Introduction
st.write(
    "The MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) dataset is a widely used "
    "publicly available dataset that contains de-identified health data for patients admitted to "
    "the intensive care unit (ICU). This page provides an overview of the MIMIC-III dataset."

# About MIMIC-III
st.header("About MIMIC-III")
st.write(
    "MIMIC-III is a database developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) "
    "that includes clinical data from patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, USA. "
    "The dataset covers a wide range of information, including demographics, vital signs, laboratory test results, "
    "medication orders, and more."
)

# Accessing the dataset
st.header("Accessing the Dataset")
st.write(
    "Researchers and developers can access the MIMIC-III dataset by completing the necessary "
    "training and obtaining access through the PhysioNet website. More information on accessing the dataset can be found "
    "on the [MIMIC-III website](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/)."

# Dataset Features
st.header("Key Features of the MIMIC-III Dataset")
st.write(
    "The MIMIC-III dataset includes a variety of features, such as:\n"
    "- Patient demographics\n"
    "- Vital signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure)\n"
    "- Laboratory test results\n"
    "- Medication orders and administrations\n"
    "- Diagnoses and procedures\n"
    "- Clinical notes and reports\n"
    "- And more."
